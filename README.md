Data Operation Code Updated[03-05-2016]

1. Python can load images into memory and create list with element size : 481x321x3, This format can be directly used in Keras

2. Label data was in the form of *.mat. We extracted single ground truth from it into form of csv [csv](https://github.com/wuga214/Boundary-Detection-via-Convolution-Deconvolution-Neural-Network-with-BMA/blob/master/Conv-Deconv-Image-Process/data/groundTruth/train_label_flat.csv) [matlab script](https://github.com/wuga214/Boundary-Detection-via-Convolution-Deconvolution-Neural-Network-with-BMA/blob/master/Conv-Deconv-Image-Process/data/groundTruth/matlabscript.m)
